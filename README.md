# PingPongBallTracker

OpenCV ball tracker with extended kalman filter predictions and OpenGL Graphics

Goal: Have a pingpong ball that is tracked in x,y,z coords in real life and real time using diffrent camera angles.
Then, use the extended kalman filter to use vectors to predict the end position of the ball with collisions of the table and paddle. 
The make a 3d graphic using OpenGL of the ball, table, and predicted path of the ball (and maybe the robotic arm that will be used).
