# PingPongBallTracker

OpenCV ball tracker with predictions 

Goal: Have a pingpong ball that is tracked in x,y,z coords in real life and real time using diffrent camera angles.
Then, some predicitons algorithm to predict the end position of the ball with collisions of the table and paddle. 
The possibly make a 3D graphic using OpenGL of the ball, table, and predicted path of the ball (and maybe the robotic arm that will be used).
